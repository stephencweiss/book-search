# Book Search
This web app allows the client to use the Google Books API to search for books.

# Minimum Requirements
  [ ] Type in a query and display a list of books matching that query.

  [ ] Each item in the list should include the book's author, title, and publishing company, as well as a picture of the book.

  [ ] From each list item, you should also be able to navigate to more information about the book, but this information does not necessarily need to appear on a page within your application. In other words, this could link out to an external site with more information about that particular book.
